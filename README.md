# Data Structures and Algorithms Collection

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms. It includes implementations, examples, and documentation for stacks, trees, queues, and lists. This resource is intended for students, educators, and professionals looking to deepen their understanding of these core concepts in computer science.

## Features

- **Stacks**: Implementation of LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure with operations like push, pop, and peek.
- **Trees**: Various tree structures including Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and more, along with traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Queues**: Implementation of FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure with operations like enqueue, dequeue, and front.
- **Lists**: Singly and Doubly Linked Lists with comprehensive methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
